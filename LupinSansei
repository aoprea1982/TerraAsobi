Amazon S3 
https://blog.trendmicro.com/amazon-macie-deep-security/
As a quick recap, Amazon S3 works with two simple objects: buckets and keys. A bucket is essentially a root folder where you data will be stored. A key is a data object.

These basics structures allow you to store your data in any way that makes sense for your application. From a security perspective, the service provides a number of tools to help you configure access to your data:
	

    Bucket policies
    IAM policies
    Access Control Lists (ACLs)
    Query string authentication/URL-based access
Intelli J community Edition as IDE

Using the Alexa Top 10,000 sites, determine which sites have S3 buckets that allow directory listing, downloads, and uploads enabled.
